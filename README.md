## Some interesting projects I've developed
- Penjat (Hangman) - The classic guessing game where one player thinks of a word and the other tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. Available in [Catalan](https://perseus.cat/penjat) and [Spanish](https://perseus.cat/penjat-es). 

- [Life Line](https://perseus.cat/life-line) - A representation of your lifetime relationships. You can introduce up to 5 different relationships, indicating for each year how close it has been. Then you can visualize a graphic representation.
