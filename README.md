## Some interesting projects I've developed
- Penjat (Hangman) - The classic guessing game where one player thinks of a word and the other tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. Available in [Catalan](https://perseus.cat/penjat) and [Spanish](https://perseus.cat/penjat-es).

- [Memory](https://darosa01.github.io/memory-game/) - The classic memory game where you have to remember the pairs to win. Includes 4 game modes! (1 Player, 2 Players, 1 Player vs Computer and an Online mode on the way)

- [Calculadora Castellers](https://darosa01.github.io/CalculadoraCastellers/) - Discover one of the most typical Catalan cultural traditions: Els Castells! This calculator allows you to find out the weight of the castles by entering the number of people that make up each element, as well as an approximate average weight in each case. You can also use the predefined cases to discover the most famous castle types. 

- [Life Line](https://perseus.cat/life-line) - A representation of your lifetime relationships. You can introduce up to 5 different relationships, indicating for each year how close it has been. Then you can visualize a graphic representation.
